In bronze inscriptions, the semantic component [[日]] (“sun/day”) was added to this character. The phonetic component was mixed with another common semantic component [[勹]] (\"bow down\") in Warring States period, hence the incorrect analysis in ''{{w|Shuowen Jiezi}}'' of this character as {{Han compound|勹|日}}."
