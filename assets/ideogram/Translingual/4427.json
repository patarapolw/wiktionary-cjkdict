These may be written identically as {{lang|mul|月}}, but in careful use they are distinguished, with the inside of {{lang|mul|⺼|sc=Hani}} being written with unattached diagonal strokes. This is particularly an issue in looking up characters by radical; compare the [[Index:Chinese radical/月|月 index]] and [[Index:Chinese radical/肉|肉 index]]."
