This creates an appearance roughly equivalent to [[土]] enclosed in the top part of [[冂]].\n\nHowever, in simplified Chinese, the central vertical stroke in <span lang=\"zh-Hans\" style=\"font-size:24px\">角</span> extends to the bottom of the character (as in [[用]]). This difference applies to all simplified Chinese [[Index:Chinese radical/角|characters]] containing this [[⾓|radical]].\n\nNote that the Chinese and Japanese stroke order is slightly different for the fifth and sixth strokes, as illustrated in the animations above."
