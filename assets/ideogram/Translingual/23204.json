In {{w|traditional Chinese}} and Vietnamese {{w|History of writing in Vietnam|Nom}}, the standard written form of the radical is {{l|mul|糹}} (with three dots on the bottom), while in {{w|simplified Chinese}} the radical is written {{l|mul|纟}} (with a {{l|mul|一}} line below {{l|mul|幺}} that slants upwards).\n\n[[Category:CJKV radicals]]"
