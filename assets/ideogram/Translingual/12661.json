Due to [[w:Han unification|Han unification]], both traditional Chinese and Japanese shinjitai forms are encoded under the same [[code point]]. The appearance of this character will differ depending on the font used.\n* In [[Simplified Chinese]], the component [[File:U26c29-ue0102.svg|25px|text-bottom|𦰩󠄂|link=𦰩]] is simplified to {{l|mul|又}} instead, giving the character {{l|mul|叹}} (<code>U+53F9</code>).\n* Two [[w:CJK Compatibility Ideographs|compatibility ideographs]] exist for this character. <code>U+FA37</code> corresponds to the [[kyūjitai]] form of this character while <code>U+2F84C</code> is an alternative form used in Taiwan and North Korea which is similar to Japanese shinjitai but the top right component is written <big>{{lang|mul|sc=Hant|艹}}</big> (4 strokes) instead of <big>{{lang|mul|sc=Jpan|艹}}</big> (3 strokes)."
