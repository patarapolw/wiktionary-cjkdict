Used as a number since the {{w|Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn}} and {{w|Warring States period}}s.\n\nVarious theories have been proposed for its original meaning:\n* [[w:zh:屈萬里|Qu Wanli]], {{w|Qiu Xigui}} and others propose that it originally refers to a type of dancer-musicians. This usage is attested in the oracle inscriptions. This may be supported by ancient literature, e.g. ''{{w|Shijing}}'', which mentions a type of dance called {{zh-l|萬舞}}.\n* Lin Yiguang proposes that it is an ancient form of {{och-l|丏}}, acting as a phonetic component in {{och-l|賓}}.\n* Some propose that it is a differentiated form of {{zh-l|*亥}}."
