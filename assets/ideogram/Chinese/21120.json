This became the current form in the [[clerical]] [[script]].\n\n:This glyph was used as {{och-l|載|id=3}} or proper nouns in oracle bone script.\n\n;“one-year field”\n:The glyph of this sense is composed of {{och-l|𡿧}} (“calamity”) and {{och-l|田|field}}. This glyph is also used as an alternative form of {{och-l|災}}.\n\n;“steroid”\n:This character was practically obsolete before it was revived as a modern translation for ''[[steroid]]''. It is also a {{liushu|p|nocap=1}} in this sense; the upper part represents the three side chains on the ring system, and the {{lang|zh|田}} component represents the tetracyclic core of steroids.
