Accessed February 23, 2010.</ref>\n* As in historical on-readings ending in -ゐ, such as \"ゆゐ\" and \"るゐ\", most dictionaries do not have \"すゐ\", \"つゐ\", and \"づゐ\" as historical readings for 錘. According to historical data, the on-readings of 錘 are the modern \"すい\" and \"つい\", as well as \"づい\". However, the Dai Kanwa Jiten, has the -ゐ historical on-readings.\n{{attention|ja|please confirm the second note, translated from the Japanese Wikipedia}}\n\n{{ja-kanjitab|おもり|yomi=k}}"
