The serving [[bowl]]s were called {{m|ja|慳貪}}{{m|ja|振り}}{{m|ja|鉢|tr=kendon-buri-bachi}}, literally “greedy” + “in that fashion” + “bowl”. The ''ken'' portion was [[elide]]d, producing ''donburi-bachi'', and then the ''-hachi'' was dropped to produce ''donburi''.\n* Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, ''donburi'' in reference to “a bowl filled with large amount of food” may be cognate with {{m|ja|どんぶり|tr=donburi}}, an [[onomatopoeia]] of something heavy [[plunk]]ing into deep water, or something big and soft [[plop]]ping down, related to [[onomatopoeia]] {{m|ja|どぶり|tr=doburi}}, {{m|ja|どぶん|tr=dobun}}, {{m|ja|どんぶ|tr=donbu}}, and {{m|ja|どん|tr=don}}, all of generally similar meanings. The food starts with a large portion of rice, also referred to as {{m|ja|丼飯|tr=donburi meshi}}, which could be analyzed as “plopped-down rice”.\n: ''Donburi'' is also used to refer to something “rough, approximate, not finely worked”, as in the phrase {{m|ja|丼勘定|tr=donburi kanjō||rough approximation, loose estimate}}. This is consistent with a derivation from the onomatopoeia, but not from the restaurant terms.\n\nThe kanji spelling shows {{m|mul|井||a well}} with a dot in the center, possibly indicating something thrown into the well. This could suggest that the {{cog|ltc|-}} reading ''təm<sup>X</sup>'' may similarly derive from [[onomatopoeia]].",
